# AtrixOS-1.0 (and other stuff)

# My html stuff

Thanks For viewing. AtrixOS isn't a actual os, rather a project from my childhood remade. There might be some other stuff in here too. download the source code to get the "os" and all other files.

it has multiple deprecated html features. they do not impact the experience.
